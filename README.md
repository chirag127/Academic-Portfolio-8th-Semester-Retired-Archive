### **Mission: To Forge a High-Velocity, Self-Documenting, Frontend-Only System from a Foundational Academic Archive.**

This repository represents a radical transformation—a retired 8th-semester academic portfolio reborn as a paradigm of 2026-era engineering. It adheres to the strictest principles of modern, frontend-only architecture, serving as both a functional application and a testament to cutting-edge development standards.

---

## ✨ Core Principles

*   **Singularity Architecture:** Engineered for zero defects, high velocity, and future-proof resilience.
*   **Frontend-Only Mandate:** No servers, no databases. All logic resides and executes in the browser.
*   **AI-Native Integration:** Built for direct, secure, client-side interaction with next-generation AI services via user-provided keys.
*   **Spatial-Adaptive UI:** A modern, intuitive user interface crafted with Tailwind CSS v4, designed for any device or form factor.

## 🚀 Technology Stack

This project is built on a foundation of elite, late-2025 standard technologies, chosen for their performance, reliability, and developer experience.
